<p>Agents were tested on a total of 4202 instances, consisting of basic tasks, object permanence control tasks, and object permanence test tasks.</p>
<p>Children were tested on a total of 42 instances, consisting of basic tasks, object permanence control tasks, and object permanence test tasks. They were able to play some of those tasks more than once, namely the Chiandetti &amp; Vallortigara (2011) object permanence tests. They could also play the basic tasks and the object permanence control tasks as many times as they wanted.</p>
<p>For the 14 kinds of agents, the number of instances that they passed, as well as the proportion of total instances that they passed, is provided in the table below. The behaviour of the random walkers and random action agents serve as a baseline for chance performance.</p>

<p>For the 14 kinds of agents, we computed how many points they obtained from those that were available. For instances with lava, the worst possible score is to wait until the penultimate step and then step into lava, returning a score of -2. In instances without lava, the worst score is -1, if they wait for the episode to time out. The maximum score is a theoretical score, if they obtained the reward(s) immediately with no time decrement. The agents were only tested on instances with a time limit, so this maximum is impossible to obtain as it takes at least some time to navigate towards a reward. The children had some tutorial tests that did not have a time limit, and so they were able to achieve this maximum in some instances. Another caveat is that the children often navigated into lava if they had made the wrong choice and wanted to move on quickly, resulting in a lower reward than they would have obtained had they waited for the episode to time out.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-tasks">Basic Tasks</h5>
<p>These are basic tasks that test fundamental capabilities required for interacting successfully with the Animal-AI Environment.</p>
<p>First, the success rates across this subset of tests is provided. It should be noted that children were given tests with no time limit, meaning they had as long as they needed to complete the tests. This was not the case for the agents, who had a time limit so that the episode eventually ended and didn’t delay training. However, we expect that the children will get very high scores on these tests. The tasks they failed are the ones involving lava.</p>

<p>In this task, the agent needs to search for a reward, while avoiding lava. They might be bad at navigating or scared of lava, so the choice they make at the start is useful. The fundamental choice is whether to go left or right. The agents could also stay on the choice platform, making no choice at all. This covers a small proportion of the arena, so it is justified to assume that chance selection approaches 50:50.</p>
