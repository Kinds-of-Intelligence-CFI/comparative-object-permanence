    "This script runs a series of hand-coded agents on the object permanence tests and stores the results in a MySQL database. It relies on a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All the dependencies are installed, particularly that animalai is installed properly. I recommend using a conda environment and setting up an ipykernel for running this notebook.\n",
    "2. AnimalAI is installed as an executable in the `env` folder.\n",
    "3. A recent installation of MySQL, configured with a database, user, and password, as well as the local (or remote) address to store on. MySQL WorkBench is a good IDE for interacting with MySQL (this was created with WorkBench 8.0)\n",
    "4. A CSV file in the same directory as this notebook called `databaseConnectionDetails.csv`, containing columns `database_name`, `hostname`, `username`, and `password` for database connection, with the values in the next row. This is gitignored."

    "## Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries of parameters to define a vanilla braitenberg agent. This agent can interact with the animal-ai environment in a purposeful and meaningful way. The agent's default action is `FORWARDS`. If the agent is currently stationary, then it chooses to go `FORWARDSLEFT` or `FORWARDSRIGHT` with a probability of 0.5. It repeats that action until it is no longer stationary, or if one of the following conditions occurs. If it detects a `GoodGoal`, `GoodGoalBounce`, `GoodGoalMulti`, or a `GoodGoalMultiBounce` directly ahead in its field of view, it chooses the `FORWARDS` action. If it sees one of those objects to its left or right, it turns appropriately until it is directly ahead. If it detects a `DeathZone` or a `BadGoal` directly ahead in its field of view, it chooses the `BACKWARDS` action. If it sees one of those objects to its left or right, it turns appropriately until it is directly ahead. If it sees an immovable object (a `Wall`, `Ramp`, `Tunnel`, etc.) directly ahead, then it chooses to go `FORWARDSLEFT` or `FORWARDSRIGHT` with a probability of 0.5. If the obstacle is still directly ahead, and the agent is not stationary, then it perseverates that action. If the obstacle is to it's left but not directly ahead, it chooses `FORWARDSLEFT`, and vice versa for `right`. This means that the agent can rudimentarily navigate around obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "The agent uses raycasting to implement these rules, as well as knowledge of its velocity. Raycasts only apply on the x-z plane of the environment, meaning that the agent cannot detect objects above or below its current y coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent is hand-coded to be able to navigate towards appetitive stimuli and away from aversive stimuli, and to navigate around neutral obstacles. These are general capabilities required of any agent in the Animal-AI Environment. This agent certainly lacks object permanence, as well as many other capabilities that are useful for solving these specific tests of object permanence. However, this agent serves as a good baseline for how we might expect a minimally capable agent to perform on this battery of tests\n",
