    "1. All the dependencies are installed, particularly that animalai is installed properly. I recommend using a conda environment and setting up an ipykernel for running this notebook.\n",
    "2. AnimalAI is installed as an executable in the `env` folder.\n",
    "3. A recent installation of MySQL, configured with a database, user, and password, as well as the local (or remote) address to store on. MySQL WorkBench is a good IDE for interacting with MySQL (this was created with WorkBench 8.0)\n",
    "4. A CSV file in the same directory as this notebook called `databaseConnectionDetails.csv`, containing columns `database_name`, `hostname`, `username`, and `password` for database connection, with the values in the next row. This is gitignored."

    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries of parameters to define some vanilla braitenberg agents. These agents have hard-coded predictable behaviours. If they detect a `GoodGoal`, `GoodGoalBounce`, `GoodGoalMulti`, or a `GoodGoalMultiBounce` in front of them, they move forwards. If they detect one of these in front of them and to the left, they execute the forwards and left action at the same time. *Mutatis mutandi* if the object is in front and to the right. If they detect a `DeathZone`, `BadGoal`, or a `BadGoalMulti` in front of them, they move backwards. If they detect one of these in front of them to the left, they move backwards and to the right. If they detect one of these in front of them and to the right, they move backwards and to the left. If they detect something in front of them, they'll continue doing that response until the end of the episode, unless it is a forwardsright or forwardsleft action, in which case they have a 0.05 probability of switching between them. If they do not detect anything in front of them, they go forwardsright or forwardsleft, with a probability of 0.05 of switching between those (and a 50/50 chance of starting with one of those actions). This encourages exploration of the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these agents are hand-coded. They do not have anything resembling object permanence. They simply go towards good things and away from bad things, exploring the space in a very simple manner if they can't see anything. These agents thus serve as excellent controls for comparison, because they can interact with the environment in a very simple way, but we can be sure that they lack the sophisticated capability of object permanence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents vary in their visual acuity, which varies on 2 axes. The first is the number of rays that the agent can generate for viewing the space. The second is the number of degrees of viewing that they can see. The first agent has one ray directly in front of it, angle here is irrelevant."
