    "This script runs a series of random walkers on the object permanence tests and stores the results in a MySQL database. It relies on a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All the dependencies are installed, particularly that animalai is installed properly. I recommend using a conda environment and setting up an ipykernel for running this notebook.\n",
    "2. AnimalAI is installed as an executable in the `env` folder.\n",
    "3. A recent installation of MySQL, configured with a database, user, and password, as well as the local (or remote) address to store on. MySQL WorkBench is a good IDE for interacting with MySQL (this was created with WorkBench 8.0)\n",
    "4. A CSV file in the same directory as this notebook called `databaseConnectionDetails.csv`, containing columns `database_name`, `hostname`, `username`, and `password` for database connection, with the values in the next row. This is gitignored."
