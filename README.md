# comparative-object-permanence

A repository for the comparative measurement project, investigating object permanence in biological and artificial machines.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the most recent build of animalai from [here][def] and unzip it into the `env` folder. Inside `env`, you should see 2 directories (`AnimalAI_Data` and `MonoBleedingEdge`) as well as `AnimalAI.exe`, a crash handler and a `.dll` file. There is also a `.gitignore` file so you don't accidentally push the environment to the remote repository.
3. Run any files you want (add more as being built).
